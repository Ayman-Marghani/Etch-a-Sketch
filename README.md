# Etch-a-Sketch

### Project Description
This is the fourth project in the foundations course (JavaScript section) of the Odin Project curriculum. The project is a browser version of the classic Etch-A-Sketch game, where users can create a grid of squares and "draw" on them by hovering over the squares with their mouse.

### Learned Skills
In this project, I demonstrated my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Specifically, I learned how to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) using JavaScript, including creating and removing elements dynamically, styling elements programmatically, and handling user events such as mouse hover.

The key skills I acquired and showcased in this project include:

- HTML: Structuring the web page and setting up the necessary elements.
- CSS: Styling the page, including layout, colors, and basic styling for the grid and buttons.
- JavaScript: Creating and removing grid elements dynamically, handling user input for grid size, and implementing the "drawing" functionality by changing the background color of squares on mouse hover.
